## Verbal Ability

#### 1. Convert the sentence into active voice:
**"It is time for the station to be closed."**

Answer:
"It is time for someone to close the station."

>The original sentence is in passive voice.<br> To make it active, we add a generic subject like "someone", as the doer is not specified.

##### Questions 2,3,4 are passage based questions

#### 5. Replace the sentence in quotes:
**"He found the pencil 'as he cleans' the bed."**

Answer:
**"He found the pencil as he was cleaning the bed."**

>The verb tense "cleans" (simple present) is incorrect in this context.<br> Since the action happened in the past, we replace it with "was cleaning" (past continuous) to maintain tense consistency.

#### 6. Combine the phrases into a coherent sentence:

1. I will get money
2. my astrologer
3. towards the end of my life

Answer:
**"My astrologer told me that I will get money towards the end of my life."**

#### 7. Fill in the blank with the correct option:
**The best course of action will be _____ the message.**

*Options*:
a) telling
b) to tell
c) tell
d) tell to

Answer:
**b) to tell**

*Complete Sentence*:
**"The best course of action will be to tell the message."**

*Explanation*:
>After phrases like "the best course of action is/will be", the correct grammatical form is the infinitive (to + verb).<br> Hence, "to tell" is the correct choice.

#### 8. Convert the sentence into indirect speech:
**The coach said, "If you stay after school tomorrow I will solve it."**

Answer:
**The coach said that if I stayed after school the next day, he would solve it.**

Explanation:

>"stay" → "stayed" (past tense)
"tomorrow" → "the next day"
"I will" → "he would" (will → would in indirect speech)
Pronouns are changed appropriately based on context.

#### 9. Fill in the blank with the correct option:
**The movie had ended ____ we could arrive.**

Options:
a) in
b) before
c) by
d) when

Answer:
**b) before**

Complete Sentence:
"The movie had ended before we could arrive."

Explanation:

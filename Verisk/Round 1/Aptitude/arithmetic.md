### Arithmetic Aptitude

#### 1. find the value of p such that 12p modulo 7 = 6.

Answer:

##### Solution to the Modular Equation 12p ≡ 6 (mod 7)
Let's break it down:

1. Simplify the modulus:
    First, we simplify 12(mod7):
    12=1×7+5
    So, 12≡5(mod7).

2. Rewrite the congruence:
    Now, substitute this back into the original equation:
    5p≡6(mod7)

3. Find the multiplicative inverse:
    To isolate p, we need to find the multiplicative inverse of 5 modulo 7. This is a number, let's call it x, such that 5x≡1(mod7).
    Let's test values:

    - 5×1=5≡5(mod7)
    - 5×2=10≡3(mod7)
    - 5×3=15≡1(mod7)
    - So, the multiplicative inverse of 5(mod7) is 3.

4. Multiply by the inverse:
    Multiply both sides of the congruence 5p≡6(mod7) by 3:
    3×5p≡3×6(mod7)
    15p≡18(mod7)

5. Simplify again:
    Now, simplify 15(mod7) and 18(mod7):
    -   15≡1(mod7)

    -   18≡4(mod7)

6. Final result:
    Substituting these back into the congruence:
    - 1p≡4(mod7)
    - p≡4(mod7)

The smallest non-negative integer value for p is 4.

#### 2. A shopkeeper purchased some tables for ₹2400. He sold two-thirds of these tables at a 10% loss. What profit percentage must he sell the remaining tables for to achieve an overall profit of 25% on the total cost?

Answer:

Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

1. Calculate the Cost of the First Batch:
    The shopkeeper sold 2/3 of the tables.
    Cost of 2/3 of tables = 32​×₹2400=₹1600.

2. Calculate the Selling Price of the First Batch:
    These tables were sold at a 10% loss.
    Loss amount = 10% of ₹1600=10010​×1600=₹160.
    Selling Price of the first batch = Cost - Loss = ₹1600−₹160=₹1440.

3. Calculate the Cost of the Remaining Tables:
    The remaining tables are 1−2/3=1/3 of the total tables.
    Cost of remaining 1/3 tables = 31​×₹2400=₹800.

4. Calculate the Desired Overall Selling Price:
    The shopkeeper wants an overall profit of 25% on the total cost (₹2400).
    Desired overall profit = 25% of ₹2400=10025​×2400=₹600.
    Desired overall Selling Price = Total Cost + Desired Profit = ₹2400+₹600=₹3000.

5. Calculate the Required Selling Price for the Remaining Tables:
    To achieve the desired overall selling price, the remaining tables must be sold for:
    Selling Price of remaining tables = Desired overall Selling Price - Selling Price of first batch
    Selling Price of remaining tables = ₹3000−₹1440=₹1560.

5. Calculate the Profit Percentage for the Remaining Tables:
    Profit on remaining tables = Selling Price of remaining tables - Cost of remaining tables
    Profit on remaining tables = ₹1560−₹800=₹760.

    Profit Percentage = (CostProfit​)×100%
    Profit Percentage = (₹800₹760​)×100%=0.95×100%=95%.

**Therefore, the shopkeeper must sell the remaining tables at a 95% profit to achieve an overall 25% profit.**

#### 3. What is the simple interest percentage for an interest of ₹72 on a principal amount of ₹400 over a period of 2 years?

Answer:

To find the simple interest percentage (rate), we use the simple interest formula:

Simple Interest (SI)=(Principal (P)×Rate (R)×Time (T)​)/100

We are given:

- Simple Interest (SI) = ₹72

-    Principal (P) = ₹400

-    Time (T) = 2 years

We need to find the Rate (R).

**Rearranging the formula to solve for R:
R= (SI×100)/ (P×T) ​**

Now, substitute the given values into the formula:
R = (72\*100)/400\*2
**Therefore, the simple interest percentage is 9%.**

#### 4. The sum of two numbers is 72. The two numbers cannot be in which of the following ratios?

A) 1:1
B) 3:5
C) 5:7
D) 7:9
E) 5:13

**D) 7:9** 

Because 72 ÷ (7+9) = 72 ÷ 16 = 4.5, which is not an integer, so the numbers can’t be in 7:9 ratio.

#### 5. A train is moving at a speed of 210 km/h. How much time will it take to cover a distance of 700 meters?

Answer:
**Time = 12 seconds**
- a kmph = a \* (5/18) m/s
- t = (d/s) seconds

#### 6. A number is divided into two parts in the ratio 11:13. Which of the following numbers cannot be divided in this ratio?

Options:
A) 72
B) 144
C) 112
D) 240

Answer: 
**C) 112**
Explanation:

- To divide a number in the ratio 11:13, the total must be divisible by:
11+13=24
11+13=24

Now check each option:

    72 ÷ 24 = 3 ✅
    144 ÷ 24 = 6 ✅
    112 ÷ 24 = 4.666 ❌
    240 ÷ 24 = 10 ✅

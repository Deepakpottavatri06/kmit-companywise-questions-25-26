Minimum Operations to Balance Storage Bins
ðŸ“˜ Problem Statement:

You are given an array items of length n, where items[i] represents the number of items in the i-th storage bin.

You can perform the following operation any number of times:

    Choose the bin with the maximum number of items (any if multiple)

    Remove 1 item from it and add it to the bin with the minimum number of items (any if multiple)

ðŸŽ¯ Objective:

Perform such operations until the difference between the number of items in any two bins is at most 1.

Return the minimum number of operations required to reach this state.
ðŸ§¾ Input:

    An integer n â€” number of bins

    An array items of size n, with items[i] as the count of items in the i-th bin

ðŸ§¾ Output:

    An integer â€” the minimum number of operations to balance the bins

âœ… Constraints:

    2 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 2 Ã— 10^5

    1 â‰¤ items[i] â‰¤ 10^9

Example-1:-
Input: items = [1, 3, 2, 5]
Output: 2

Explanation:
Step 1: [1, 3, 2, 5] â†’ move 1 from bin 4 to bin 1 â†’ [2, 3, 2, 4]  
Step 2: [2, 3, 2, 4] â†’ move 1 from bin 4 to bin 3 â†’ [2, 3, 3, 3]

All bins now have values 2 or 3 â†’ difference is â‰¤ 1

Example-2:-
Input: items = [4, 4, 4]
Output: 0

Explanation:
Already balanced. No operation required.

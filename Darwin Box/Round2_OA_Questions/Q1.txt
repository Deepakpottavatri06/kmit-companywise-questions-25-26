Given an array of words, calculate the total number of distinct permutations possible by rearranging the characters of each word individually, and then multiplying the permutation counts of all words.

Example:
Input: ["too", "hot"]

For "too":
Total characters = 3
Repeated character 'o' occurs 2 times
Permutations = 3! / 2! = 6 / 2 = 3

For "hot":
All characters are distinct
Permutations = 3! = 6

Total permutations = 3 Ã— 6 = 18
